## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `documentation`: Improvements or additions to documentation
- `duplicate`: This issue or pull request already exists
- `enhancement`: New feature or request
- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Extra attention is needed
- `invalid`: This doesn't seem right
- `question`: Further information is requested
- `wontfix`: This will not be worked on

## Getting Started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request.

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to 'metadata' files like .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

## Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
